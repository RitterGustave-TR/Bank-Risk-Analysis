## CREDIT: A necessity in todays economic environment, hard to build.
<p>Your credit score is important and impacts your quality of life. Building credit and maintaining a high credit score is incredibly valuable as loans are necessary for investments such as purchasing a home or a car. </p>

<p> Building good credit can be difficult as variables deterministic of credit score such as age of credit limit are outside of ones control.  </p>

<p> Herein we strive to unviel ones abilty to pay back thier loan by analyzing variables that are not dependenct upon credit score. </p>

<p> This exploration is an exercise for the Home Credit Default Risk competition on Kaggle sponsored by Home Credit Group. </p>
